<p>We signed up on Insane.gg and tested the promo code hellag by making a deposit of just $1. Our bonus balance was instantly credited with an additional $0.60, giving us $1.60 in total to spend on case openings and upgrades. The best part? The promo works with deposits as low as $0.50, making it one of the most accessible welcome offers we&rsquo;ve seen in 2025. For larger deposits, the 60% bonus scales accordingly &mdash; if you put in $10, you start with $16, which goes a long way in unlocking better skins and daily raffles.</p>
<h2>How to Use Insane.gg Referral Code?</h2>
<p>We walked through the bonus activation and here&rsquo;s exactly how you can do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit insane.gg and log in using your Steam account</li>
<li>Once logged in, click the &ldquo;Refill&rdquo; button from the right-side menu</li>
<li>In the pop-up box, locate the field for Promo or Referral Code</li>
<li>Enter the code hellag</li>
<li>Choose your payment method and click &ldquo;Deposit&rdquo;</li>
<li>The +60% bonus will appear in your Bonus Balance automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no hidden steps or forms &mdash; as soon as the payment clears, your bonus is ready to use.</p>
<h2>The Insane.gg Referral Code is hellag</h2>
<p>Out of all the codes we tested, hellag stood out for one simple reason: the minimum deposit requirement is only $0.50. Unlike most other platforms that ask for $5 or more, Insane.gg lets you activate the full bonus even on micro-deposits. We confirmed this by testing different amounts &mdash; the +60% was consistent every time. This code is ideal for beginners, low-budget users, or anyone wanting to test the site with minimal risk.</p>

<h2>Other Insane.gg Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
<h3>Fan Bonus</h3>
<p>Once we applied the code and made our deposit, we activated a second-tier Fan Bonus by setting our Steam nickname to &ldquo;INSANE.gg&rdquo; and using an official avatar. That unlocked another +25% on our next deposit, stackable with the referral bonus.</p>
<h3>Daily Luck</h3>
<p>By following Insane.gg on Telegram and Steam, and depositing at least $1, we unlocked the Daily Luck Wheel. Prizes ranged from coins to full skins &mdash; we hit a $3 win on our third spin.</p>
<h3>Skin for Deposit</h3>
<p>We deposited $20 and automatically entered the Skin Drop Pool, which rewards random players with CS2 skins daily. We didn&rsquo;t win on day one, but the odds increase with daily consistency and total deposit volume.</p>
<h3>Bingo</h3>
<p>We earned Bingo tickets through our deposit and gameplay volume. Each ticket gave us a shot at skins, coins, and upgrade tokens &mdash; the pool updates daily. Tickets can also be gifted, traded, or bought for $1.</p>
<h3>Leaderboard</h3>
<p>We joined the Daily and Weekly Leaderboards after activating our code and playing for 30 minutes. The top 10 players win extra skins and Gold. Even lower ranks earn mystery case entries and task multipliers.</p>
<h2>Insane.gg Royalty Club</h2>
<p>Frequent users are added to a tiered Royalty system, where additional perks unlock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalized bonus offers</li>
<li>Lower minimums for special cases</li>
<li>Private raffles and giveaways</li>
<li>Invite-only access to seasonal events</li>
</ul>

<p>We made multiple deposits via both PayPal and crypto and tested skin withdrawals. All transactions were processed within 15 minutes. Skins were delivered through peer-to-peer trades on Steam. The platform is transparent about drop rates, has support via live chat and Telegram, and provides fair play systems on all games.

<h2>Insane.gg Sports &amp; eSports</h2>
<p>While primarily a case and upgrade site, Insane.gg features fantasy-style tie-ins with CS2 and major eSports tournaments. Users can win special themed skins, case drops, and bonus entries for wagering during these events. We saw a &ldquo;Spring Arena&rdquo; CS2 tournament that gave deposit multipliers and event-specific wheel spins.</p>
<h2>Insane.gg Original Games</h2>
<p>We tested Upgrade, Contract, and Wheel games. The Upgrade feature has a provably fair multiplier system, where we turned a $0.30 skin into a $1.50 item within four rounds. The Wheel bonus lets you spin for skins or balance using daily tickets.</p>
